          An endangered language or moribund language is a language that is at risk of disappearing as its speakers die out or shift to speaking other languages.
          Language loss occurs when the language has no more native speakers and becomes a "dead language". A dead language may still be studied through recordings or writings, but it is still dead or extinct unless there are fluent speakers.
          Language shift most commonly occurs when speakers switch to a language associated with social or economic power or spoken more widely, the ultimate result being language death.

          Ethnologue's 2005 count of languages in its database, excluding duplicates in different countries, was 6,912, of which 32.8% (2,269) were in Asia, and 30.3% (2,092) in Africa. Areas with a particularly large number of languages that are nearing extinction include: Eastern Siberia, Central Siberia, Northern Australia, Central America, and the Northwest Pacific Plateau. Other hotspots are Oklahoma and the Southern Cone of South America.

          Causes that put the populations that speak the languages in physical danger, such as: war and genocide; natural disasters, famine, disease.
          Causes which prevent or discourage speakers from using a language, such as: cultural, political, or economic marginalization; political repression; urbanization; intermarriage.
          Poverty, disease and disasters often affect minority groups disproportionately. Often multiple of these causes act at the same time.

          Language endangerment affects both the languages themselves and the people that speak them. Also, this affects the essence of a culture.
          As communities lose their language they often also lose parts of their cultural traditions which are tied to that language, such as songs, myths, poetry, local remedies, ecological and geological knowledge and language behaviors that are not easily translated.
          During language loss—sometimes referred to as obsolescence in the linguistic literature—the language that is being lost generally undergoes changes as speakers make their language more similar to the language that they are shifting to.
          A majority of linguists do consider that language loss is an ethical problem, as they consider that most communities would prefer to maintain their languages if given a real choice.

          Linguists, members of endangered language communities, governments, nongovernmental organizations, and international organizations such as UNESCO and the European Union are actively working to save and stabilize endangered languages.
          Language documentation is the documentation in writing and audio-visual recording of grammar, vocabulary, and oral traditions of endangered languages.
          Language revitalization is the process by which a language community through political, community, and educational means attempts to increase the number of active speakers of the endangered language.
          Language maintenance refers to the support given to languages that need for their survival to be protected from outsiders who can ultimately affect the number of speakers of a language.
